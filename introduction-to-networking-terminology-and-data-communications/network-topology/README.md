# Network Topology

**Network Topology:**

Network topology refers to the physical or logical layout of devices, connections, and communication pathways within a network. It defines the structure and arrangement of network components, such as computers, routers, switches, and cables, and how they are interconnected. Network topology determines how data flows between devices and affects factors like performance, scalability, fault tolerance, and security within the network.

**Types of Network Topology:**

**1. Physical Topology:** Physical topology refers to the physical arrangement of devices and connections in a network. It involves the actual layout of cables, devices, and their physical interconnections. Common physical topologies include bus, star, ring, mesh, and hybrid topologies. Physical topology affects factors like cable length, device placement, and the overall physical infrastructure of the network.

* Bus Network Topology
* Star Network Toplogy
* Ring Network Toplogy
* Mesh Network Topology
* Tree Network Toplogy&#x20;
* Hybrid Network Topology

**2. Logical Topology:** Logical topology, also known as signal topology, defines how data flows within a network conceptually, regardless of its physical layout. It focuses on the logical paths and protocols used for data transmission. Examples of logical topologies include Ethernet, Token Ring, and ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode). Logical topology determines how devices communicate and exchange data, irrespective of their physical locations or connections.

Understanding both physical and logical network topologies is essential for designing, configuring, and managing networks effectively. The physical topology defines the physical connectivity and layout, while the logical topology defines the logical paths and protocols used for data transmission. Both aspects work together to ensure efficient and reliable network communication.
