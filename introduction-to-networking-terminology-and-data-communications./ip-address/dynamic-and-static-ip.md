# Dynamic and Static IP

**1. Dynamic IP ( public IP ):** Think of dynamic IP as a temporary address. When your device connects to the internet, your internet service provider (ISP) assigns you an available IP address from a pool of addresses they have. This IP address can change each time you connect or restart your modem/router. It's like checking into a hotel room where you get a different room number each time you visit.

Dynamic IP addresses are more common because they are cost-effective for ISPs and allow them to serve more customers with a limited number of IP addresses. It's suitable for most users who don't require a fixed address and simply want to access the internet.

**2. Static IP ( private IP ):** In contrast, a static IP is like having a permanent address. With a static IP, your ISP assigns you a specific, unchanging IP address for your device. It's like owning a house with a fixed street address that never changes.

Static IP addresses are typically used by businesses or individuals who require consistent access to specific services or need to host websites, servers, or remote access applications. They provide stability and make it easier for others to find and connect to your device or services reliably.

While dynamic IPs are automatically assigned by the ISP, static IPs require a special request from the user, and sometimes an additional fee may be associated with having a static IP address.

In summary, dynamic IPs are temporary and change each time you connect, while static IPs are permanent and remain the same. Dynamic IPs are suitable for most users, while static IPs are preferred for specific needs like hosting services or remote access.
